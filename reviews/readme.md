# Review Documents

Most W3C TAG reviews happen in the issue comments in this repo.  However when it is necessary to issue a more formal document (for example, for a review that covers multiple issue) those documents will live here. Review documents produced prior to 2020 can be found in dated directories at the root of this repo.
