# WebVR API Draft Feedback

[Draft under discussion](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/) at [this revision](https://github.com/w3c/webvr/commit/201b8451c05e25d0bced4af9b7e5f20c48b20898)

We extracted IDL and example code from the draft in question using a snippet run at the developer tool command line:

```js
Array.prototype.slice.call(
  document.querySelectorAll(".idl,.es-code")
).map(function(n) { return n.innerText; }).join("\n\n\n");
```

IDL replicated here for clarity:

```

   * If this VRDisplay supports room-scale experiences, the optional
   * stage attribute contains details on the room-scale parameters.
   * The stageParameters attribute can not change between null
   * and non-null once the VRDisplay is enumerated; however,
   * the values within VRStageParameters may change after
   * any call to VRDisplay.submitFrame as the user may re-configure
   * their environment at any time.

## General Discussion

Thanks to @toji and the editors for adding a thorough [explainer doc](https://github.com/w3c/webvr/blob/master/explainer.md). Seeing explicit goals and non-goals is great. It's also great to see so much demo & sample code at https://webvr.info/samples/

There are a few concerns that come up when reading the spec:

 - As a meta-point about the overall design, the current model of `submitFrame()` and the `VRDisplay::requestAnimationFrame()` is very clunky and it's unclear how input processing that needs to route through the main thread will be compatible with higher refresh rates. We recently reviewed the Offscreen Canvas proposal and noted that it's got major issues in terms of getting a rAF pumped to it. Coordinating input, audio, video, and other main-thread/DOM types is a challenge and it seems as though this sort of synchronization is key to delivering a good experience in VR. We'd like to see a coherent end-to-end story about working at higher-than-default-display refresh rates and how a separate context (iframe, worker, etc.) can be used to effectively drive a VR experience without exposure to the slower refresh of the main thread (and potential main-document content jankiness).

 - The `has*` properties of `VRDisplayCapabilities` smells wrong. In general, we've seen a lot of systems attempt to provide "compatibility" flags (e.g. [`CSS.supports()`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-supports-api) and similar past APIs for SVG features) and developers eventually come to rely on feature detection based on calling APIs (or using them) to get a less buggy read on the feature support situation. We'd like to see the API designed to accommodate this instead.

 - `VRLayer` needs a constructor and probably a supertype if you're going to be adding more layer types in the future.

 - Should the upcoming [Permission Delegation API](https://noncombatant.github.io/permission-delegation-api/) or an attribute for [`<iframe sandbox="...">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) be used instead of a new `allowvr` attribute?

 - `submitFrame()` doesnâ€™t seem to be needed in an initial API, instead can the implicit capturing of the canvas can be used? It seems odd to have two separate modes of capture (implicit and explicit) living on the same object with the difference between them being only which display is rendered with which content. If `submitFrame()` is added for VR displays, should it not also be added for main display drawing?

 - `VRDisplay` seems to be part of a stunted hierarchy. Is there a common supertype that also explains the main document's implicit Display and a type that represents it?

 - `requestPresent()` API only takes a single VRLayer at the moment. What happens when a web developer wants to switch a layer or add a layer (assuming that multiple layer types are going to be added in the future)?

 - Moving the global event handlers and methods under `navigator.vr` is great in https://github.com/w3c/webvr/pull/116

 - `getFrameData()` populating an in-param is very strange. One supposes this is the ["bring your own buffer" analogue from the Streams API](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#byob-readers), but it's odd that this is not similarly low-level. If this is about binary packed data, why not take a buffer? And if it's not about packed binary data, what possible reason is there to design around the JS object model (instead of, e.g., improving GC heuristics about specific object types as we have seen, e.g., for short-lived "enum" style objects and Promises).

 - Can `resetPose()` fail? If so, should it return a promise or potentially throw an exception?

 - Can `stageParameters` change? If so, how will the developer be informed? At first glance there doesn't seem to be an event for this.

 - GamepadPose and VRPose have a lot of the same attributes, should they inherit from a superclass?

 - `VREyeParameters.renderWidth` - what does the `render` indicate? Could it just be `width`?
